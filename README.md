# Write a data science post
 
 This is an exercise in analyzing data and writing a Data Science post.
 The post can be found in this link: https://medium.com/@ininjame/do-long-descriptions-mean-higher-price-ddf87b7f289f
 
 The target this time is a dive into AirBnb data for Seattle area.  
 The exercise includes wrangling data to answer a few business questions, as well as testing a basic predictive model on the created features.
 
 All code can be found in the **analysis2.ipynb** notebook (note the number 2, the one without number is old!).  
 All data used in the notebook is included within this repo.
 The notebook also contains detailed explanations and comments, so I'm keeping the readme short.
 
 All images used in the article can also be found within the repo.  
 
 Enjoy and hope you have fun!
